	<center><h2>What is Floral Beadwork?</h2><center>
	
	<p>Before European conntact many indigenous tribes used dyed quills in the artwork instead of beads
	   this is known as quillwork. The Anishinaabe mainly got their beads by trading felts with the French
	   for their beads. The Anishinaabes beadwork is mostly abrstact style floral because of thee woodland
	   enviroment they live in unlike the more geometric style beadwork of the Sioux.<p>
